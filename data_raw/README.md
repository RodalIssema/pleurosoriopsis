# data_raw

Raw data files for *Pleurosoriopsis* project, mostly in `xlsx` format.

`datalogger_raw.xlsm`: Temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), and photosynethically active radiation (PAR, μmol of light per sq m per sec) measured by dataloggers at two sites, Okutama (site of the independent gametophyte colony) and Uratakao (site of the sporophyte population). Additional sites were also measured, but not included in this analysis because of too much missing data due to mechanical failures.

`okutama_gameto_size.xlsx`: Size data including length and width of individuals, split into different sheets based on presence or absence of gametangia.

`okutama_summary_data.xlsx`: Pre-processed climate summary data for the Okutama site. Not used.

`pleurosoriopsis_data_figs.xlsx`: Pre-processed data in several sheets. Data used for this project include:

- cover data (area of gametophytes in sq. cm) measured once per month for four 10 x 10 cm plots at the Okutama site (sheet 1).

- Gemmae count and length measured in 10 individuals per monthly census. The data provided are mean values with standard deviation already calculated (sheet 3).

`uratakao_summary_data.xlsx`: Pre-processed climate summary data for the Uratakao site. Not used.
